This utility is used for uploading programs to the Vex. I have compiled only 
compiled it for Linux x64 so far. If you want to compile it yourself, you 
can get the source at: http://personalpages.tds.net/~jwbacon/Ports/distfiles/roboctl-0.3.8.tar.gz

To compile: *
  1. Open a terminal
  2. Enter the Lib/C/ directory of the roboctl folder
  3. run make
  4. Navigate to ../../Commands/Vexctl
  5. run make

* This assumes you kind of know what you are doing
